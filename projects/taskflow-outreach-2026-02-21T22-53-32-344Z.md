Hi there,

I wanted to reach out about TaskFlow, a solution built for Remote-first companies with 10-50 employees, particularly in tech, consulting, and creative agencies.

THE PROBLEM:
Remote teams struggle with task visibility and coordination across different time zones, leading to duplicated work, missed deadlines, and poor communication

OUR SOLUTION:
A real-time task management platform designed for distributed remote teams to collaborate seamlessly across time zones

KEY FEATURES:
• Real-time task synchronization across all devices
• Time zone-aware notifications and deadlines
• Integrated video chat for quick discussions
• Visual timeline view of all projects
• Slack and Microsoft Teams integration

PRICING:
Freemium model - Free for teams up to 5, $10/user/month for unlimited

WHY NOW:
We're launching Q2 2026 and looking for early users.

I'd love to get your feedback or set up a quick demo if this resonates with you.

Best regards,
The TaskFlow Team
